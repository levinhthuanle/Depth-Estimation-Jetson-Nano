# Depth Estimation using YOLOv7
## Project Overview:
1. This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals in navigation through the processing of 2D images. Real-time processing of 2D images from a camera produces relative depth information to determine pathways and obstacles. These relative depth values are converted into cases in the rule set and represented through tactile feedback modules to aid visually impaired individuals in movement.
## Hardware:
1. This system will be integrated into a Jetson Nano computer, enabling visually impaired individuals to make decisions while moving and avoid obstacles effectively.
## Dependencies:
Required Libraries: Transform, ONNX
